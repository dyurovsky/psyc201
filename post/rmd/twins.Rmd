Load libraries and set theme
```{r load_libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 18))
```

load twin iq data and have a look at the first few rows
```{r load_data}
twins <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyurovsky/psyc201/master/data/demos/twins.csv")

head(twins)
```

find the correlation between the iq of twin a and twin b
```{r corr}
twin_cor <- cor(twins$twin_a, twins$twin_b)

twin_cor
```

make a scatterplot of the relationship between twin a and b iqs. Also plot a regression line and annotate with the correlation coefficient.
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(twins, aes(x = twin_a, y = twin_b)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "darkred") + 
  annotate("text", x = 75, y = 120, size = 6,
           label = paste0("r = ", round(twin_cor, digits = 2)))
```

make a linear regression predicting twin b from twin a
```{r lm}
twin_lm <- lm(twin_b ~ twin_a, data = twins)
summary(twin_lm)
```

the slope of a regression line is equal to the correlation when the independent and dependent variabels are both standardiZed and no intercept is fit
```{r}
scale_twins <- twins %>%
  mutate(twin_a = scale(twin_a), twin_b = scale(twin_b))
scale_twins


scale_twin_lm <- lm(twin_b ~ twin_a + 0, data = scale_twins)

summary(scale_twin_lm)
twin_cor
```

That's because the slope of a regression line is r * sd_x / sd_y
```{r slope}
twin_cor * sd(twins$twin_b) / sd(twins$twin_a) 

coef(twin_lm)["twin_a"]
```

What is r^2? proportion of variance explained
```{r}
# Check that variance is the same as the square of standard deviation
var(twins$twin_b)
sd(twins$twin_b)^2

# Compute the total sum of squares for twin_b
SST <- sum((twins$twin_b - mean(twins$twin_b)) ^ 2)

# Plot what this is equivalent to
ggplot(twins, aes(x = 1, y = twin_b)) + 
  geom_dotplot(method = "histodot", binwidth = 1, stackdir = "center", binaxis = "y") + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(twins$twin_b), color = "darkred")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
# This is the same as an intercept-only model!
twin_intercept <- lm(twin_b ~ 1, data = twins)
sum(resid(twin_intercept)^2)

# Now look at the linear model again
ggplot(twins, aes(x = twin_a, y = twin_b)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(twins$twin_b), color = "darkred"))  

# Get the residuals from the linear model
SSE <- sum(resid(twin_lm)^2)

# Compute the proportion of variance explained
(SST - SSE)/SST

# Same as R^2!
summary(twin_lm)

SST
```
