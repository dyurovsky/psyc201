Load tidyverse package and set plot theme
```{r, message = F}
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_classic(base_size = 16))
```

Let's take a quick look at the empirical data
```{r empirical}
meeting_admitted <- 388
meeting_died <- 66
meeting_mortality <- meeting_died / meeting_admitted

nonmeeting_admitted <- 2154
nonmeeting_died <- 535
nonmeeting_mortality <- nonmeeting_died / nonmeeting_admitted

mortality_diff <- meeting_mortality - nonmeeting_mortality

# Make a tibble to show the results
tibble(type = c("Nonmeeting", "Meeting", "Difference"), 
       mortality = c(nonmeeting_mortality, meeting_mortality, mortality_diff))
```

Let's simulate it

```{r sample_func}
day_diff <- function() {
  
  # Make an array with the right number of patients
  patients <- c(rep("Meeting", meeting_admitted), 
                rep("NonMeeting", nonmeeting_admitted))
  
  # randomly select the total who died from the array
  died <- sample(patients, meeting_died + nonmeeting_died) 
  
  # Compute the difference in mortality between Meeting and NonMeeting Days
  died_meeting <- sum(died == "Meeting") / meeting_admitted
  died_nonmeeting <- sum(died == "NonMeeting") / nonmeeting_admitted
  
  return(died_meeting - died_nonmeeting)
}

# One function call
day_diff()
```

Now lets draw samples and pot
```{r thousand_samples, fig.height=4, fig.width = 6}
thousand_diffs <- tibble(diff = replicate(1000, day_diff()))

ggplot(thousand_diffs, aes(x = diff)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mortality_diff, color = "#bb0000", size = 2) 
```

Sample and plot along with our original result
```{r empirical_data, fig.height=4, fig.width = 6}
thousand_diffs <- tibble(diff = replicate(1000, day_diff()))

percentile <- .025

thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff)

# Find top and bottom 2.5% percents
lower_percentile <- quantile(thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff), percentile)
upper_percentile <- quantile(thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff), 1-percentile)

#add a vertical line to the random samples to show the empirical data
ggplot(thousand_diffs, aes(x = diff)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mortality_diff, color = "#bb0000", size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lower_percentile, color = "#224477", size = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = upper_percentile, color = "#224477", size = 2)
```

Where does our difference lie?
```{r}
# Compute the proportion of samples that the actual difference was greater than
mean(mortality_diff >= thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff))
```

What about nonteaching hospitals?
```{r non_teaching_empirical}
meeting_admitted <- 3709
meeting_died <- 901
meeting_mortality <- meeting_died / meeting_admitted


nonmeeting_admitted <- 22054
nonmeeting_died <- 5432
nonmeeting_mortality <- nonmeeting_died / nonmeeting_admitted


mortality_diff <- meeting_mortality - nonmeeting_mortality


# Make a tibble to show the results
tibble(type = c("Nonmeeting", "Meeting", "Difference"), 
       mortality = c(nonmeeting_mortality, meeting_mortality, mortality_diff))
```

Sample and plot along with our original result
```{r nonteaching_empirical_data}
thousand_diffs <- tibble(diff = replicate(1000, day_diff()))

# Find top and bottom 2.5% percents
lower_percentile <- quantile(thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff), percentile)
upper_percentile <- quantile(thousand_diffs %>% pull(diff), 1 - percentile)

#add a vertical line to the random samples to show the empirical data
ggplot(thousand_diffs, aes(x = diff)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = mortality_diff, color = "#bb0000", size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = lower_percentile, color = "#224477", size = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = upper_percentile, color = "#224477", size = 2)

```
